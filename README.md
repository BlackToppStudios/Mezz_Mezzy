The Mezzanine is a set of multi platform C++ libraries designed to help create high performance
videos games. The Mezzanine is focused on games requiring 3d physics, 3d graphics, 3d sounds and
common facilities that such games need. This is just one component of many.

## About this Tool ##

This tool is still under initial development, when complete it will be an entry point to basic Mezzanine
functionality.
